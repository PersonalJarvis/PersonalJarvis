"""Brain factory: delivers a `BrainCallback` (async (str) -> str) for the pipeline.

The factory is the only authorised entry point for Phase-1b launchers
(`speech/pipeline.py` + `speech/watchdog.py`). It attempts in order:

1. **BrainManager** (Phase 5.5, tier-aware) — Router tier (Haiku) or sub tier (Opus).
2. **GeminiTestBrain** — Phase-1b fallback if BrainManager is missing/crashed.
3. **Echo** — last resort so the pipeline does not die completely.

The factory is therefore **drop-in-compatible**: regardless of which brain level
loads, the pipeline always receives something that can `async def __call__(text) -> str`.

# Router-tier: pure-dispatcher set (grown via documented ADR-0011 amendments;
# the exact-match regression test pins the current membership) plus three
# self-mod tools (Phase 7.3, registered separately in the loader). See
# ``router.py:SYSTEM_PROMPT`` and ADR-0011 (including the Phase-7/8 amendment
# + Wave-4 amendment ``spawn-sub-jarvis`` -> ``spawn-worker``) and
# Master-Plan §22 / Persona-Mandate Phase 3.
#
# Baseline (Mandate-Phase-3): run-shell, screen-snapshot, multi-spawn,
# spawn-worker. Phase 5 re-introduced dispatch-to-harness; Phase 8.4
# (Plan §6.4 Quality-Gate) added dispatch-with-review — both legitimately
# extend the set without breaking the pure-dispatcher spirit.
#
# Rationale: Hauptjarvis is a pure dispatcher. Direct actions outside this
# list (open_app, type_text, remember, whoami …) belong to the OpenClaw
# bridge — the router delegates them via ``spawn_worker``. Read-only lookups
# (search-web, wiki-recall, awareness-recall) and safe-gated direct actions
# (computer-use, cli-tools, plugin-tools) are router-tier by design — see the
# ADR-0011 amendments (2026-05-24 CLI, 2026-05-29 Computer-Use, 2026-06-01
# plugins, 2026-06-10 inline web search).
# This prevents the spawn-reflex behaviour documented in
# ``docs/persona-research.md`` Section 2 and keeps the tool set deterministic.
