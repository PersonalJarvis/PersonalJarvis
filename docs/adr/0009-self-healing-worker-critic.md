# ADR-0009 — Self-Healing Worker-Critic-Loop with Action/Observation Invariant

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-26)
**Phase:** 6 — Self-Healing Multi-Agent Orchestrator

## Context

Phases 0-5 deliver Voice→Brain→Tool/Harness, but every tool call is a single shot: if it fails, the user hears an error message and has to try again. The master-plan goal "Sub-Jarvis as Kontrollierer with critic loop" (see `Jarvis-Behavior/persona-delegation-mandate.md`) cannot be fulfilled with the current `SubJarvisManager` (Phase 5) — it spawns a sub-brain, but without verification, without retry, without worktree isolation, and writes directly into the user's working tree.

The research document `SubAgentenSt/Unbenanntes Dokument (4).md` (to be moved to `docs/research/self-healing-architecture.md`) distills six converging pattern lines (Reflexion, Self-Refine, CRITIC, Constitutional AI, Aider Architect/Editor, OpenHands Action/Observation) into a single viable architecture for a single-user Windows orchestrator. Phase 6 implements this architecture.

The core question is not "which algorithm" — but "which invariant carries everything else". Six of the top-10 failure modes (hallucinated execution, file races, lost mission state, WS-disconnect data loss, cascading failures, triangle deadlock) are neutralized by a single design decision: **Action/Observation strict separation as a typed event stream with WAL**.

## Decision

**Phase 6 builds the Self-Healing Worker-Critic-Loop on four non-negotiable invariants** — everything else composes around them.

### 1. Action/Observation invariant (OpenHands pattern)

Every worker step is a pair `(Action, Observation)`:

- **Action** = typed Pydantic object emitted by the LLM (`ToolCall`, `Edit`, `Bash`, etc.).
- **Observation** = typed Pydantic response produced by the runtime (`CommandOutput`, `FileEdit`, `Error`).

The LLM may **never formulate an Observation itself** — only the runtime module that executed the Action signs the Observation. The voice-readback path (the main Jarvis telling the user the result) reads back **only Observations**, never LLM narrative ("I did X…"). Violating this rule = BLOCKER in code review.

### 2. Worker-Critic-Loop with MAX_CRITIC_LOOPS=3

```
Worker.execute() -> diff
  -> Critic.review(goal, diff, log_tail, prior_reflections) -> verdict
       verdict.approve  -> MissionApproved
       verdict.revise   -> Worker.resume(critique) [iteration += 1]
       verdict.reject   -> MissionFailed("critic_rejected")
  -> on iteration == 2: upgrade Critic model Sonnet -> Opus
  -> on iteration == 3 + revise: MissionFailed("critic_loop_exhausted")
```

`MAX_CRITIC_LOOPS = 3` is **hardcoded**, not a config parameter. Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023) defaults to 5; we reduce it to 3 because Aider/Cline production data show that 3 iterations are enough and cost is 2x lower. **Parameterizing it would invite drift** (someone sets 10, a mission costs $50). Whoever wants to change it changes the constant and writes a new ADR.

The Critic must cite `evidence_ref` with `file:line`, `log_line:N` or `test:name` — bare prose verdicts are rejected orchestrator-side as an abstention and retried once with adversarial framing.

### 3. Worktree-per-task + Windows Job Object

Every worker runs with `cwd = sub-agents-outputs/<mission-slug>/<task-id>/workspace/` — a branch freshly created via `git worktree add -b agent/<task-id>`. The user's working tree is **never** written to directly.

Every worker subprocess is assigned to a per-mission Windows Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. If the orchestrator crashes, the OS atomically reaps the entire descendant tree — no zombies, no orphans. Pattern: `claude-squad/session/git/worktree.go` + `microsoft/win32-jobobject`.

### 4. Typed event stream + SQLite WAL

Every event is a `frozen=True` Pydantic model with `event_id (UUIDv7)`, `seq (server-assigned monotonic)`, `mission_id`, `parent_event_id`, `source_actor`, `ts_ms`, `payload`. **Write-ahead requirement:** the event is `INSERT`ed into SQLite (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;`) **before** it is published on the bus. Crash recovery at startup: scan for non-terminal missions, mark as `FAILED("crash_recovery")`, reap orphan PIDs from the events log.

The WebSocket layer (Mission Control UI) replays via the `Last-Event-ID` pattern from SQLite on reconnect. This avoids Redis/NATS/Temporal — a single-user system does not need the daemon overhead.

### 5. Positioning relative to existing Phase-5 components

The Phase-5 `SubJarvisManager` (`jarvis/brain/sub_jarvis.py`) stays **untouched**. Phase-6 code lives in parallel under `jarvis/missions/` (see file layout in the research document §"Recommended file/module structure"). The main Jarvis dispatches depending on the risk tier:

- **safe / monitor / single-shot** -> existing `SubJarvisManager` (Phase 5, tool loop without critic)
- **ask / multi-step / repair / refactor / cross-file** -> new `MissionManager` (Phase 6, Worker-Critic-Loop)

Heuristic: a mission is Phase-6-eligible if the router classifier returns `code` **or** the user utterance contains an `external_system_marker` OR more than two `spawn_verbs` (cf. ADR-0011 §2). Exact wiring comes in the Phase-6 plan.

## Consequences

+ **Six failure modes mitigated in one stroke** via event stream + WAL: hallucinated execution, file races, lost mission state, WS-disconnect data loss, cascading failures, triangle deadlock (see research document Section I).
+ **The voice path stays untouched.** The main Jarvis (Haiku tier) still emits a single `MissionDispatched` event in Phase 5 — Phase 6 is just a new subscriber.
+ **Cost discipline via $5 per-mission + $50 daily budget** (`jarvis.toml:[budget]`). Hard abort + voice warning at 50%/80%.
+ **Crash safety without a daemon.** SQLite WAL + Job Objects replace Temporal/Redis. If Jarvis crashes: recovery on the next start. If the user pulls the power: ditto.
+ **Critic verdicts are grounded.** Empty-evidence verdicts are rejected. Sycophancy risk (SycEval: 58% default rate) is countered through adversarial framing + anchor token (original goal in every critic call).
- **Two tool stacks in parallel** (`SubJarvisManager` + `MissionManager`) until Phase 6 is in production. No big-bang refactor, but additive. Risk: cognitive overhead at routing — when Phase 5 / when Phase 6?
- **Worker subprocesses are out-of-process**, not in-process. A pattern break from ADR-0008 (Computer-Use). **Rationale:** Computer-Use is Plan-Observe-Act in a single-brain loop; Phase-6 workers are third-party binaries (`openclaw agent`, `codex exec`) with their own permission surface — subprocess isolation is correct here, not stubborn.
- **Worktree-per-task costs disk** (Cursor community measurement: 9.8 GB over a 2 GB codebase with many worktrees). Mitigation: `cleanup_period_days = 14`, optional Dev Drive (ReFS block cloning).

## Alternatives Considered

- **In-process worker (like ADR-0008 Computer-Use):** fails in three places — (1) `openclaw agent` and `codex exec` are external binaries, not Python code; (2) parallel file edits without a worktree would have race conditions; (3) a worker crash would take Jarvis down as a whole. **Rejected.**
- **MAX_CRITIC_LOOPS as config:** abused forever as a tuning knob ("just bump it to 5 briefly for this one problem"). Cost discipline requires hardcoding. **Rejected.**
- **Single-critic pass (no loop):** the Self-Refine paper shows that even one iteration yields ~20%; the Reflexion paper shows 3 iterations are the cost/value optimum. A single-pass critic is throwaway money. **Rejected.**
- **Docker-per-worker (OpenHands pattern):** 30-60s cold start destroys the voice UX. Single-tenant, no security gain over Job Object + worktree. **Rejected.**
- **Redis Streams / NATS / Temporal as the event backbone:** an additional daemon lifecycle that Ruben would have to maintain. SQLite WAL delivers 95% of the value at 0% ops cost. Escape hatch documented: if the main Jarvis and the Kontrollierer ever move into separate processes, swap `EventBus.publish` -> `redis.xadd`. **Rejected for now.**
- **Cross-model critic as default** (Worker = Claude, Critic = Codex/GPT): the multi-agent-debate literature supports it, but it doubles auth flows + cost trackers. **Optional via config flag, not default.**
- **Phase 6 overrides Phase 5:** unnecessary risk concentration. Phase 5 works for the smalltalk-tier Sub-Jarvis (see ADR-0011); Phase 6 is additive for multi-step missions. **Rejected.**

## Open

- **Reflexion memory layout:** do we persist the last 3 critic reflections as `reflections.md` in the worktree (Reflexion-paper pattern) or as JSON in SQLite (query-baker)? Decision when writing `jarvis/missions/critic/runner.py`.
- **Cross-model-critic trigger:** should the switch to Codex/GPT as the critic happen automatically when Worker = Claude and iteration == 3, or only via config? Gather observations during Phase 6, amend if needed.
- **Worktree-cleanup policy on MissionFailed:** immediate `git worktree remove --force` or keep for N days for forensics? Proposal: keep + automatic prune after 7 days.
- **Voice readback at iteration 2:** should the user hear "I'm trying again" after the critic verdict `revise`, or loop silently until approval? Default silent, opt-in via `[voice].announce_critic_loop = true`.
